      summary: Get Alerts Events. Format
      description: "This API endpoint allows you to list the alert events for your
        account.\n\nAlerts events can be filter by product, target type, group ID,
        instance ID, and event type.\n\nThe options for products are: APM, BROWSER,
        MOBILE, SERVERS, PLUGINS, SYNTHETICS, and ALERTS.\n\nThe options for entity
        type are: Application, Server, KeyTransaction, Plugin, MobileApplication,
        BrowserApplication, and Monitor.\n\nThe options for event type are: NOTIFICATION,
        DEPLOYMENT, VIOLATION_OPEN, VIOLATION_CLOSE, VIOLATION, and INSTRUMENTATION.\n\nThe
        group ID option is normally the same as the entity ID (e.g. an Application
        group ID and entity ID will be the same), however PLUGINS have a group ID
        representing the PLUGIN itself, and entity IDs for all instances of that PLUGIN
        type.\n\nSee our documentation for a discussion on \noutput pagination."
